**Step 3: Enter Your Username and Password**

At the Cox Webmail login page, enter your Cox username and password:

- **Username**: This is typically the full email address you use to sign up for Cox Internet (e.g., `john.doe@cox.net`).

- **Be Cautious with Phishing Emails**: Never click on links or open attachments from unknown senders. Phishing emails are designed to steal your login and personal information.
- **Change Your Password Regularly**: Update your password periodically to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to your account.
- **Log Out After Use**: Always log out when you're finished, especially if you're using a shared or public computer.
